      <h4>
        <b>Wait. An IDE? What's that?</b>
        <br> An IDE, or integrated development environment, is a way for programmers to easily write programs. To program an EV3, the most widely used IDE is the EV3 MINDSTORMS software. From now on, I'll refer to the LEGO MINDSTORMS software as an IDE.
        <br><br>
        <b>How do I get started?</b><br> To get started, head over to the LEGO website and download the <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software">EV3 Education software</a>. Install it, and start the program. You should
        be greeted with this starting screen.

        <br>Congratulations! You just set up the IDE!

      <h2>Intro to Programming</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>
        <b>How do I make a new program?</b>
        <br>It's pretty easy, actually. All you need to do is click <code>File</code>, click <code>New Project</code>, and then double-click <code>Program</code>.<br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicface2304/FLL-Coding/master/media/newfile.png"><br> Programs are stored in files called projects, which can have logs, images, sounds, and more programs, all in a single file.
        <br><br>
        <b>How does programing work?</b><br> Programing starts with a programming language. The IDE supports only one language, which is block-based. A block-based language means that you don't need to type a single word, which makes it a lot easier to
        learn. In a block-based language, there is a start, and then there are multiple functions which follow it, one after another. Each function chain is called a thread, which is a set of tasks the EV3 reads and executes. When the EV3 is multitasking,
        it is called multi-threading or parallel execution because there are multiple "threads" running at the same time. When you "run" the program, the IDE sends the program to the EV3, which the EV3 stores and then executes.
        <br><br> Thankfully, programming is <i>really</i> easy thanks to the good design of the IDE.

      <h2>Blocks</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>
        <b>Blocks? What are those?</b>
        <br>Ah, blocks. They are the basis of the EV3 programming language. Remember the functions we were talking about earlier? Blocks are a representation of the functions within the EV3 programming language.
        <br><br><b>It's time to meet the blocks!</b>

            World: meet program! Action blocks are how your program interacts with the physical world, either by moving motors, displaying an image, or playing a sound.

            These blocks are the traffic signals of the programming world. They tell the program to stop, start, or repeat an action.

            These blocks take data and manipulate it. Use these blocks to multiply, divide, (calculate the sine of?) your data! In addition, you can use these blocks to store your data in variables.

          <h4>
            These blocks do weird stuff. They can access files for datalogging, stop the program, send bluetooth messages, and read raw sensor data. Don't mess with these if you don't know what you're doing!
