      <h2>Setting up the IDE</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>
        <b>Wait. An IDE? What's that?</b>
        <br> An IDE, or integrated development environment, is a way for programmers to easily write programs. To program an EV3, the most widely used IDE is the EV3 MINDSTORMS software. From now on, I'll refer to the LEGO MINDSTORMS software as an IDE.
        <br><br>
        <b>How do I get started?</b><br> To get started, head over to the LEGO website and download the <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software">EV3 Education software</a>. Install it, and start the program. You should
        be greeted with this starting screen.
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicface2304/FLL-Coding/master/media/startscreen.png">
        <br>Congratulations! You just set up the IDE!

    <div id="intro" class="coral card static">
      <h2>Intro to Programming</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>
        <b>How do I make a new program?</b>
        <br>It's pretty easy, actually. All you need to do is click <code>File</code>, click <code>New Project</code>, and then double-click <code>Program</code>.<br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicface2304/FLL-Coding/master/media/newfile.png"><br> Programs are stored in files called projects, which can have logs, images, sounds, and more programs, all in a single file.
        <br><br>
        <b>How does programing work?</b><br> Programing starts with a programming language. The IDE supports only one language, which is block-based. A block-based language means that you don't need to type a single word, which makes it a lot easier to
        learn. In a block-based language, there is a start, and then there are multiple functions which follow it, one after another. Each function chain is called a thread, which is a set of tasks the EV3 reads and executes. When the EV3 is multitasking,
        it is called multi-threading or parallel execution because there are multiple "threads" running at the same time. When you "run" the program, the IDE sends the program to the EV3, which the EV3 stores and then executes.
        <br><br> Thankfully, programming is <i>really</i> easy thanks to the good design of the IDE.

      <h2>Blocks</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>
        <b>Blocks? What are those?</b>
        <br>Ah, blocks. They are the basis of the EV3 programming language. Remember the functions we were talking about earlier? Blocks are a representation of the functions within the EV3 programming language.
        <br><br><b>It's time to meet the blocks!</b>

      </div>
      <br> Now that we know the main categories of blocks, let's take one apart to figure out it's anatomy!
      <br>
      <img class="noborder" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicface2304/FLL-Coding/master/media/lego_block.png" />
      <br> The block pictured above is a color sensor block. We know it's a sensor block because the header is yellow, and we know that it interacts with the color sensor because it is pictured on the left side.<br> Currently, the block is set to see
      if it reads the same color code as 5, which is red. It outputs a boolean value (true or false) and a color code value (number 0-7).
      <br><br> Let's take a look at the different parts of the block.
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>The box in the top right corner is the port block. You can choose the port that the color sensor is connected to to target it.</li>
        <li>The box in the bottom left side is the subfunction selector. By clicking this and choosing a different option, you can tell the function block to measure or compare a different value.</li>
        <li>The 3 boxes to the right of the subfunction selector are the inputs and outputs of the block. Going from left to right:
          <ul>
            <li>The first one is an input because you can see indentations on the top. This input accepts an array object, which contains a list all of the different colors it is looking for.</li>
            <li>The second box is an output because you can see indentations on the bottom. This box outputs whether or not the colors inputted match the color that the color sensor is looking at.</li>
            <li>The final box outputs the color that the color sensor sees.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br> You can drag blocks to snap them together, like virtual legos. The outputs of one block can be dragged and snapped into another's block.<br><br>
      <b>Blocks aren't that hard!</b>
